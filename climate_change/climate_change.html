      <p>With the disappearance of Christianity as the main dogma and the daily companion of the past, western society felt more appealed by scientific believes and experimental or natural sciences backed explanations. The past shows that every society has their high priests. The druids of paganism were replaced by the clerics of the church and those by today-s omnipresent “expert” and “scientist”. As it was considered a sin to question the God of the bible, now one is considered an individual exhibiting unstable mental faculties if he dares to question the narratives and the conclusions, provided by mass media, about the alleged near-death of earth due to human caused global warming. The “scientist” became a sort of tool of mass-control to push ideologies and large-scale agendas.
        
Pushing society to accept certain new rules, social or economic reforms always follows with the problem and solution recipe, where the problem is created, repeatedly indoctrinated and the solution provided by the same forces. With climate change, the apparent anger of the people is expressed by worldwide demonstrations calling for “net-zero” goals and the solutions are echoed in news outlets daily. A prediction of today’s status quo can be read in a book from the 1970s called “The First Global Revolution” by scientist Alexander King, founding member of the Club of Rome, which implies that the whole UN climate agenda is not the average-citizen agenda it seems to be: ,,In searching for the new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming,[…] and the like would fit the bill.”
        
Regarding the claims of human caused global warming, until today it has it has never been proven by a field experiment that CO2 is actually the cause of global warming and the creation of the ozone hole, neither does a formula exist as with photosynthesis. Furthermore in the media and in everyday discussions, the main point brought up is often the alleged consensus among scientists, which is also never proven or further outlined but seems to be used as a form of denouncing critics, in a similar way church officials used the pure believe in God in the past for the same purpose.
        
The use of experts and respected scientists in combination with a state of danger pushed by influential echelons of power, is an effective tool which was coined “Revolutionary parliamentarism” during the ruling of the Bolsheviks in Russia. Where with reference to climate change controlled NGOs at the bottom push and outcry for actions to be taken in the name of all society, the media in the middle approves them and the controlled bureaucrats at the top push desired actions based on this allegedly societal desire.
        
The changes that society is already facing today like CO2 taxes, the push of electric cars and the banning of fossil fuel automobiles until 2030 in the EU all happened due to legislation. Legislations which are enforceable since the  majority does not seem to question the climate dogma itself nor the consequences on his own daily life. Today’s man has submitted himself not to church but self-convinced of his superiority on the greater fools of the past, to the “expert”. The high priest’s religion to which today-s man does not know he belongs to.
