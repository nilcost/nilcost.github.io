      <p>The concept of autonomous cars has been a widely discussed topic for the last decade. It is
not just discussed within academia and tech circles, but leaves also society in fascination
and awe. As of today, self-driving cars are being squeezed by societal and technical
challenges. However, a lot of positive changes for society wait at the end of the horizon. The
question about self-driving cars is like a coin, two-sided.
The holy grail of a fully autonomous driving system which flawlessly works in a wide array of
different surroundings is a problem that is still unsolved. Even large technology companies,
who are pouring billions of dollars into it, seem to constantly end up in a dead end. Whereby
making it work on scale around the world is the key to it being useful in daily life and
economically viable. Furthermore, also society takes its part in the equation. Currently
people like to have control over their automobile. Autonomous vehicles are a clear
contradiction to this.
Should these technical problems be solved, the other side of the coin reveals itself.
Autonomous driving could resolve in a paradigm shift in society and the global economy. The
way how transportation, economic and commune related infrastructure construction is
done in the future would change completely. The result would be a general efficiency
accelerator.
The idea of self driving cars faces challenges from a technological point of view but also from
the relationship that has been established between a humans and their personal car over a
century. Given a scenario were these problems are sorted out, it could change society in a
lot of positive ways.
In conclusion, self-driving cars are a good idea. However, it should be considered that such
a change will not come out of the blue. A lot of technological development and innovation
has to happen. To prevent this technology from ending up as a man-childâ€™s hobby project,
more brilliant minds from related academic and professional fields should work in this
industry.
